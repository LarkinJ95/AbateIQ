## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) to evoke a sense of clarity, safety, and environmental awareness. The color expresses the purpose and target audience for this application, and feels modern without being cold.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0FFFF). This hue is a subtle reference to the primary color and creates a soothing ambiance. Also creates appropriate contrast in a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Slate blue (#708090). This accent color creates visual interest but will not clash or distract. This color is analogous to the primary and has a distinct brightness and saturation, and creates emphasis in buttons, links, etc.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, providing a modern, readable, and slightly techy aesthetic. Since both are sans-serif, the app's visual presentation will be very orderly, precise and geometric.
- Use clear, modern icons that relate to environmental monitoring, safety, and data analysis.
- A clean, intuitive layout that is optimized for data-heavy dashboards and reporting views.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
